## ✨ Features

### 🧑‍💻 Experts

The **Experts** feature enables HAI Code Generator to deliver context-aware code generation tailored to specific technologies or domains.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/gifs/experts.gif" alt="Experts Feature Demo" />
  <p><i>Experts</i></p>
</div>

#### Built-in Experts

- Four built-in experts are available: **.NET, Terraform, Node.js, and Go**.
- Each provides predefined guidelines and best practices in read-only mode for quick reference.

#### Custom Experts

- Users can create custom experts to define their own guidelines and (optionally) attach up to three reference document links.
- Custom experts are stored in the `.hai-experts` folder under a subfolder named after the expert.
- Each expert folder contains:
  - `metadata.json`: Stores expert name, creation date, and any document links.
  - `prompt.md`: Contains the expert’s guidelines (required).
- If document links are provided, a `docs` folder is created with:
  - Markdown files for each processed document.
  - `status.json` to track processing status.

**Note:**  
- Expert name and guidelines are mandatory when creating a custom expert.  
- Document links are optional and can be added for richer context.

This feature allows you to extend HAI Code Generator’s knowledge with your own standards, best practices, and documentation—ensuring more accurate and relevant code generation for your unique stack.
