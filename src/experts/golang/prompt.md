## Go-Specific Rules

### 1. Project Structure & Organization  
Follow the **standard Go project layout**:  
\`\`\`
/go-project
 ├── go.mod           # Module definition and dependencies
 ├── go.sum           # Dependency checksums
 ├── main.go          # Application entry point (for executables)
 ├── cmd/             # Command applications
 │    └── myapp/      # Your application
 │         └── main.go # Application-specific entry point
 ├── internal/        # Private code for your application
 │    ├── app/        # Application core
 │    └── pkg/        # Private packages
 ├── pkg/             # Public library code
 ├── api/             # API definitions (proto files, OpenAPI specs)
 ├── configs/         # Configuration files
 ├── test/            # Additional test applications and test data
 └── scripts/         # Build and CI scripts
\`\`\`
Ensure **package cohesion** (each package serves a single purpose).  

### 2. Package Design  
- Create **small, focused packages** with clear responsibilities.  
- Follow the **"Accept interfaces, return structs"** principle.  
- Use **embedding** for composition over inheritance.  
- Keep **package names** short, clear, and avoid underscores.  
- Organize code by **domain functionality**, not technical layers.  

### 3. Error Handling  
- Treat **errors as values** and handle them explicitly.  
- Use **error wrapping** to add context: \`fmt.Errorf("failed to connect: %w", err)\`.  
- Create **custom error types** for specific error conditions.  
- Use **sentinel errors** (\`var ErrNotFound = errors.New("not found")\`) for error comparison.  
- Avoid using \`panic\` except for truly unrecoverable situations.  

### 4. Concurrency Patterns  
- Use **goroutines** for concurrent operations, but be mindful of their lifecycle.  
- Communicate between goroutines using **channels**, not shared memory.  
- Use the **context package** for cancellation, timeouts, and request-scoped values.  
- Apply **sync.WaitGroup** to wait for goroutines to complete.  
- Prevent **goroutine leaks** by ensuring they can always exit.  

### 5. Interface Design  
- Keep interfaces **small and focused** (often just 1-2 methods).  
- Define interfaces at the **point of use**, not with the implementation.  
- Use **implicit interface satisfaction** rather than explicit declarations.  
- Avoid **empty interfaces** (\`interface{}\`) when possible; use generics instead.  
- Consider the **io.Reader/io.Writer** pattern for streaming data.  

### 6. Testing  
- Write **table-driven tests** for comprehensive test coverage.  
- Use **subtests** to organize related test cases: \`t.Run("case name", func(t *testing.T) { ... })\`.  
- Create **testable designs** with dependency injection.  
- Use **_test.go** files in the same package for white-box testing.  
- Write **benchmarks** for performance-critical code.  

### 7. Dependency Management  
- Use **Go modules** for dependency management.  
- Pin dependencies to **specific versions** in go.mod.  
- Consider **vendoring** dependencies for deployment stability.  
- Minimize **external dependencies** and favor the standard library.  
- Regularly **update dependencies** and check for security vulnerabilities.  

### 8. API Design  
- Design APIs around **clear domain concepts**.  
- Use **consistent naming** conventions across your API.  
- Implement **middleware** for cross-cutting concerns.  
- Return **detailed error responses** with appropriate status codes.  
- Document APIs with **godoc comments** and OpenAPI specifications.  

### 9. Performance Optimization  
- Avoid **premature optimization**; profile first to identify bottlenecks.  
- Minimize **memory allocations** in hot paths.  
- Use **sync.Pool** for frequently allocated objects.  
- Consider **pre-allocation** for slices with known capacity.  
- Leverage **multiple cores** with appropriate concurrency.  

### 10. Code Style & Idioms  
- Follow the **official Go style** enforced by gofmt/goimports.  
- Prefer **early returns** over nested conditionals.  
- Use **named return values** for documentation, not logic.  
- Apply **consistent error handling** patterns throughout your codebase.  
- Follow Go proverbs: **"Clear is better than clever"** and **"Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating"**.  

### 11. Logging & Observability  
- Use **structured logging** with levels (info, error, debug).  
- Include **contextual information** in log entries.  
- Implement **health checks** for services.  
- Add **metrics collection** for monitoring performance.  
- Use **distributed tracing** for complex systems.  

### 12. Security Best Practices  
- Validate and **sanitize all inputs**.  
- Use **prepared statements** for database queries.  
- Apply **proper authentication** and authorization.  
- Handle **sensitive data** carefully; don't log credentials.  
- Run **security scanners** on your dependencies.
