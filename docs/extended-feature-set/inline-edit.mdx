#### ⚡ Seamless Quick Changes

Whether you're refactoring a function or fixing a typo, inline editing makes it smooth and effortless:

-   Select a block of code and click **"Edit with hAI"**.
-   Enter a simple prompt like _“Optimize this function”_ or _“Fix the bug”_.
-   Watch HAI intelligently transform your code in place — without leaving your editor.

Inline editing is ideal for:

-   Quick fixes during debugging
-   Refactoring small code snippets
-   Making documentation edits inline
-   Reducing context-switching between files or tools

🎉 **Stay in the zone** and let HAI help you code smarter, not harder.
