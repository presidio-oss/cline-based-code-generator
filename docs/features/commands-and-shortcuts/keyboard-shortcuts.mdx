HAI's keyboard shortcuts let you access AI assistance without taking your hands off the keyboard. Speed up your workflow by using hotkeys for common HAI actions.

## Default Keyboard Shortcuts

HAI comes with the following built-in keyboard shortcuts to streamline your workflow:

| Action                  | Windows/Linux | macOS   | Condition                    | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Add to HAI              | `Ctrl+'`      | `Cmd+'` | When text is selected        | Adds selected code to HAI chat            |
| Focus Chat Input        | `Ctrl+'`      | `Cmd+'` | When no text is selected     | Focuses the HAI chat input field          |
| Generate Commit Message | (unset)       | (unset) | When Git is the SCM provider | Available through the Source Control view |

    - Or go to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts

3. Click on the pencil icon next to any command to change its shortcut

4. Press the keys you want to assign to that command

5. Press Enter to save the new shortcut

## Suggested Custom Shortcuts

Here are some suggested shortcuts you might find useful:

| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |

## Keyboard-Only Workflow

With the right shortcuts, you can use HAI without ever touching the mouse:

1. Select code with keyboard navigation (`Shift+Arrow` keys)
2. Send to HAI with `Ctrl+'` / `Cmd+'`
3. Type your question and press Enter
4. Review the response and apply suggestions

## Editor Integration Shortcuts

HAI's keyboard shortcuts integrate seamlessly with VSCode's built-in shortcuts:

-   Use VSCode's selection shortcuts (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L` to select line, etc.) before sending code to HAI
-   Combine with VSCode's split editor shortcuts to view code and HAI side by side
-   Use VSCode's terminal focus shortcut (`` Ctrl+` `` / `` Cmd+` ``) before capturing terminal output

## Tips for Effective Use

-   **Learn the default shortcut first**: The `Ctrl+'` / `Cmd+'` shortcut is versatile - it adds selected code to chat when text is selected, or focuses the chat input when nothing is selected
-   **Create muscle memory**: Use keyboard shortcuts consistently to build habits
-   **Customize for your workflow**: Assign shortcuts to commands you use frequently
-   **Consider ergonomics**: Choose shortcuts that are comfortable for your keyboard layout

Keyboard shortcuts may seem like a small optimization, but they can significantly speed up your workflow when using HAI regularly. By keeping your hands on the keyboard, you maintain your coding flow while still getting AI assistance exactly when you need it.

To see all HAI commands that can be assigned shortcuts:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
