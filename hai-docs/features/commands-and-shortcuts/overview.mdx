### What are Editor Integrations?

Editor integrations are commands and shortcuts that let you use HAI right where you're working. Instead of switching to the HAI panel first, you can select code, right-click, and immediately send it to HAI for help.
These integrations appear in different places throughout VSCode:

- In the editor context menu (right-click menu) - "Add to HAI"
- In the terminal context menu - "Add to HAI"
- In the Source Control view - "Generate Commit Message"
- As keyboard shortcuts - Various HAI commands
- As Quick Fix options (lightbulb menu) - "Fix with HAI", "Explain with HAI", "Improve with HAI"

### Available Editor Integrations

HAI offers several editor integrations, each designed to enhance different aspects of your development workflow:

### How They Work

When you use these commands, HAI:

- Captures the relevant context (selected code, file path, terminal output, etc.)
- Focuses the HAI interface
- Creates a conversation with the captured context
- In some cases, automatically generates a suggested prompt

Behind the scenes, these commands use VSCode's extension API to register commands, access editor state, and control VSCode's interface.
